					<h3>Why is Tasat word count different from my software?</h3>
					<p> Tasat uses a proprietary word and character count system designed from the ground up to produce an accurate count 
					for translation purposes. This means that the word count you see in your desktop software (like Microsoft Word) might be different.
					How our word-counter differs from some other software:
					We do not count punctuation and special characters like dollar signs ($).
					The result is that our word count can often be 10-20% lower than that provided by Google or Microsoft, especially for
					 a document with a high level of formatting. However the effective work required by the translator is accurately reflected in the count.</p>

					<h3>Will my money added ever expire?</h3>
					<p>
						If you do not use Tasat  for 6 months, the money added during this period will expire. 
						By 'use' we mean: ordering jobs, or adding money. After expiry, your balance will be reset 
						to zero. To avoid this, simply order translations within the expiry date. You will receive
						 an email warning 30 days from expiry, and a further warning 7 days from expiry. Expiry is non-reversible.
						This does not mean that your added money will expire after 6 months.
						 It means your added money will expire 6 months from when you last added money or ordered a job. 
						 So if you top up $100 in January, and you order $5 of translation every month, this added money will last you 20 months as normal.
						  Basically if you use myGengo more than once every 6 months, you will never have added money expire.
						As a goodwill gesture to our existing customers, money expiry will start 6 months from now, i.e. the 10th February 2

					<h3>Can I delete jobs afterwards so that my data is kept private?</h3>
					<p> 
						 After you approve a job, you are able to delete it if you wish. Deleting removes all the original
						   content and the translated content from a job that you have approved. The main reason you would do so, 
						   would be to maintain the long-term privacy of your content.
						To delete a job, visit the job details page of an approved job. Please note that deleting a job is final!
						 There is no undo. We retain information about the price of the job, the word count and the date of the order for your records.

					<h3>What are "preferred translators"?</h3>
					<p> Our system will not allow you to choose a specific translator, but you can have one of your "preferred translators" 
					do your translation job. These are a list of translators you have selected on the feedback form as translators you would 
					like do one of your translations in the future.
					 If you're placing your first order, you will not see this option as you will not have any "preferred" translators yet.
					If you would like one of your preferred translators to do your translation, click on the "Advanced options" button on the
					 order form and select "use only my preferred translators." Please note that you must have at least 2 preferred translators before you can make the request, and based on availability, it may increase the time required to complete your job.

					<h3>Can I choose translators?</h3>
					<p>Yes, you can.
						What do you mean by "estimated time"?
						The estimated time is calculated by taking into account the pickup time (which varies depending on translators' availability) and completion time.
