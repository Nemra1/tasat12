					<h3>Why use Tasat Translations as opposed to engaging freelancers?</h3>
					<p> 
						There are many advantages of placing work with London Translations as opposed engaging freelance translators.
						These include; Time savings: We invest a great deal of time and effort in locating, selecting and qualifying language
						specialists covering many areas - which means that you don't have to.<br /> 
						Risk reduction: Engaging freelancers directly can be risky. If they become ill or let you down by missing deadlines or
						providing poor quality work, who will you turn to? London Translations staff have been in the language business for
						over a decade and are well connected within the language community.

					<h3>Which languages do you work in?</h3>
					<p>We cover all of the most commonly used business languages in addition to some of the more unusual ones.
						We specialise translating languages from Far East Asian and emerging East European markets. <br /><br />

						Remember, when requesting a translation, it is important to specify the country or ethnic group you plan to use the
						document for. There are, for example, significant differences in the Spanish spoken in Mexico, Central America,
						South America, and Europe. There are also differences between Canadian and European French, as well Brazilian and
						Continental Portuguese. If you are unsure of exactly what you need, don't worry, we are here to help you.

					<h3>Do I have to pay Value Added Tax (VAT)?</h3>
					<p> 
					You only have to pay VAT if you are in the UK or outside of the European Union or Europe itself. If you are in the
					European Union, you do not have to pay VAT unless your order is over a certain amount which varies depending
					upon which country you are in. Please call us for specific details.

					<h3>How long do translations take?</h3>
					<p> 
					The time required to complete your translation assignment depends upon the language pair(s), the length and difficulty
					of the text and the availability of particular translators. As a rough guide, it takes around 2 days to translate documents
					up to 3,000 words (around 7 to 8 pages) into any of the major commercial languages. Longer documents take
					proportionally more time to translate. If your work requires desktop publishing and camera-ready output, that work
					will take extra time. If your need is more urgent, however, we can compress these timescales using a number of techniques
					such as out of hours working and dividing the project up between individual translators.
