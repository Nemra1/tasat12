					<h3>Company Background</h3>
					<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
					 It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

					<h3>Solution</h3>
					<p> 
						Today Translations supplied simultaneous interpreters with more than 20 years experience in the field and an active knowledge of history and diplomatic affairs. Rather than a relay solution, our company provided linguists who were able to interpret from and to the three different languages (English and French, English and German, French and German). Both interpreters and delegates were supplied with ISO compliant conference equipment. 
						In addition, the translations were delivered in different formats (MS Word, PowerPoint and Excel) making use of the latest Translation Memory solutions to ensure consistent terminology and cost effectiveness to the customer.  
						Finally, our company appointed a highly-qualified journalist who was able to identify the key areas of the discussion and present the information in a clear and concise manner. The conference transcript was then translated into German and French for the international delegates.
